# Language-D
I created my programming language. 

Automatically building LALR grammar parsing table from Grammars defined in text file.

To compile the compiler (main) and compile [file_name].d by the compiler main, and then link and run [file_name]:
```
cmd
cc.bat fib
```
In development. Features to be implemented.
